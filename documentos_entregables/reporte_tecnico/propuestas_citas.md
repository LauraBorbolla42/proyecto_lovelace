    Douglas Adams.
3. >When in doubt, use brute force. Ken Thomson.

    object-oriented program is good. Bjarne Stroustrup.

1. >The most important thing in the programming language is the name. A

7. >Pensar, analizar, inventar... No son actos anómalos, son la normal
    respiración de la inteligencia. Glorificar el ocasional cumplimiento de esa
    función, atesorar antiguos y ajenos pensamientos, recordar con incrédulo
    estupor lo que el doctor universalis pensó, es confesar nuestra languidez o
    nuestra barbarie. Todo hombre debe ser capaz de todas las ideas y entiendo

8. >El universo es comparable a esas criptografías en las que no valen todos los

        Zenfonía de Beethoven. Cuando terminó, toda la audiencia se puso de pie
        y aplaudió con una mano. Fue sobrecogedor.

     abajo hasta apoyarse, en el tercero, en el borde de los dientes.
     Lo. Li. Ta. Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov.
12. >The book Dynamic Programming by Richard Bellman is an important,
     pioneering work in which a group of problems is collected together at the
     end of some chapters under the heading "Exercises and Research Problems,"
     with extremely trivial questions appearing in the midst of deep, unsolved
     problems. It is rumored that someone once asked Dr. Bellman how to tell
     the exercises apart from the research problems, and he replied: "If you
     can solve it, it is an exercise; otherwise it's a research problem."
     Donald Knuth.

1. >Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to
    the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because
    it produces objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously views himself
    as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
    Computer Programming as an Art, Donald Knuth.
2. >Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
    The texbook, Donald Knuth.
3. >When you write a program, think of it primarily as a work of literature.
    You're trying to write something that human beings are going to read. Don't
    think of it primarily as something a computer is going to follow. The more
    effective you are at making your program readable, the more effective it's
    going to be: You'll understand it today, you'll understand it next week, and
    your successors who are going to maintain and modify it will understand it.
    Donald Knuth.

1. >Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the
    computer to do. Donald Knuth.
2. >An algorithm must be seen to be believed. The Art of Computer Programming:
    Fundamental algorithms, Donald Knuth.
3. >One of the most important lessons, perhaps, is the fact that SOFTWARE IS
    HARD. From now on I shall have significantly greater respect for every
    successful software tool that I encounter. During the past decade I was
    surprised to learn that the writing of programs for TeX and Metafont proved
    to be much more difficult than all the other things I had done (like
    proving theorems or writing books). The creation of good software demand a
    significiantly higher standard of accuracy than those other things do, and
    it requires a longer attention span than other intellectual tasks.
    Donald Knuth.

    fonts on the menu. Donald Knuth.
